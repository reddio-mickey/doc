# Features

## What are the benefits of using RedSonic services?

## Time to market

With RedSonic’s APIs, your integration to Web3.0 can be done in minutes.

## Highly scalable, reliable and fast response time

On Layer 2 transactions, 10k TPS are supported. 99.9% APIs availability is guaranteed. Moreover, asset trading confirmations take only a few seconds.

## Secure and asset safety

RedSonic leverages Layer 2 to achieve scale while preserving the security of Layer 1 (Ethereum) by producing STARK proofs off-chain and verifying those proofs on-chain. Meanwhile, all asset can be stored on Layer 1 and users can interact with their assets at anytime. In addition, users can transfer their assets between Layer 1 and Layer 2 with few lines of code. 

## No smart contract experience needed

RedSonic provides APIs for both Layer 1 & Layer 2 on all smart contract functionalities, hence developers don’t need experience with smart contract. RedSonic generates and operates the smart contract on your behalf with easy-to-understand APIs.

## Cross platform SDKs

Reddio makes integration easy for your applications with SDKs for popular ecosystems such as Javascript, Unity, iOS and Android. Our various SDKs help to future-proof the user experience by ensuring that your apps and/or games are developed on a vibrant, stable ecosystem of your choice.

## **No protocol lock in**

RedSonic is partnering with all the major Layer 2 providers, like Starkware, zkSync, Scroll, etc., so you'll be able to switch easily from one provider to another with just a simple change of a given parameter.

## Zero gas fee(custom gas fee supported)

Given our partnership with Starkware, we can offer zero gas fee on Layer 2 for our StarkEx integration.

## Self service and instant support

RedSonic is built by developers for developers. We know self-service is a must-need for developers and hence we built with this in mind so all our APIs/SDKs are well-documented with a developer dashboard to facilitate all your needs. Furthermore, support is available through our ticketing system and our growing Discord community. We continue to listen to your needs and will readily integrate them into products/APIs.
